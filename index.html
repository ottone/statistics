  <h1>📊 Statistics for Cybersecurity</h1>
  <p class=class="mt-5 text-center">
  Welcome!<br><br>
  This blog collects homework and projects for the Statistics course (a.y. 2025/2026) 
  of the Master’s Degree Program in Cybersecurity.<br><br>
  The purpose of these pages is to document my learning journey, sharing reflections, 
  exercises, and research that connect <strong>statistics</strong> with <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. 
  In particular, I am interested in exploring how statistical tools can be applied to 
  network data analysis, anomaly detection, and the assessment of digital risks and 
  vulnerabilities related to cybersecurity incidents.<br><br>
  Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply curious, I hope these notes 
  may serve as inspiration and a useful resource for further study.

  <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Francesco (student ID 795563), and I am a master’s student in 
    <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> at Sapienza University of Rome (course code: 29389).<br><br>
    I have a strong interest in digital technologies and complex systems, 
    with a particular focus on <em>cybersecurity</em>, critical infrastructure protection, 
    and the evolution of cyber threats.<br><br>
    This website is a personal space where I share my homework, projects, 
    and academic activities, with the goal of documenting my studies 
    and experimenting with tools that will be valuable in my professional career.
