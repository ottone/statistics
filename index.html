  <h1>üìä Statistics for Cybersecurity</h1>
  <p class=class="mt-5 text-center">
  Welcome!<br><br>
  This blog collects homework and projects for the Statistics course (a.y. 2025/2026) 
  of the Master‚Äôs Degree Program in Cybersecurity.<br><br>
  The purpose of these pages is to document my learning journey, sharing reflections, 
  exercises, and research that connect <strong>statistics</strong> with <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. 
  In particular, I am interested in exploring how statistical tools can be applied to 
  network data analysis, anomaly detection, and the assessment of digital risks and 
  vulnerabilities related to cybersecurity incidents.<br><br>
  Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply curious, I hope these notes 
  may serve as inspiration and a useful resource for further study.
