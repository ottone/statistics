        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Statistics is a branch of mathematics concerned with the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data.
      In today’s digital age, the amount of information generated by systems, devices, and networks has reached unprecedented levels.
      Every interaction leaves a digital footprint, producing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. 
      Statistical methods provide the foundation for transforming this raw information into meaningful insights, 
      supporting both decision-making and predictive modeling.<br><br>
      Within cybersecurity, statistics plays a crucial role. Threats are often hidden within massive datasets, 
      and their detection requires identifying small anomalies against a background of normal behavior. 
      By leveraging statistical methods, cybersecurity professionals can evaluate risks, monitor patterns, 
      and anticipate potential vulnerabilities before they escalate into serious incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Defining Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      Statistics can be broadly divided into two categories: <em>descriptive statistics</em> and <em>inferential statistics</em>.<br><br>
      Descriptive statistics summarize and visualize data using measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation. 
      In cybersecurity, descriptive tools are often applied to baseline “normal” activity within a system.<br><br>
      Inferential statistics, on the other hand, employ probability theory to generalize conclusions beyond a dataset. 
      They allow professionals to test hypotheses, build predictive models, and make data-driven decisions under uncertainty. 
      Both descriptive and inferential methods provide the groundwork for anomaly detection, predictive risk modeling, 
      and performance evaluation of security controls.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevance to Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital assets, networks, and information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. 
      Modern challenges include malware distribution, phishing campaigns, insider threats, and large-scale data breaches. 
      Since all of these phenomena can be described through data, statistics offers a rigorous framework for transforming complex information into actionable intelligence.
    </p>

    <h2>Anomaly Detection</h2>
    <p>
      A fundamental application of statistics in cybersecurity is anomaly detection. 
      For example, if the average number of login attempts per user is known, 
      statistical thresholds can be set to identify suspicious deviations. 
      Methods such as Z-scores, clustering, and distribution fitting are used in intrusion detection systems 
      to highlight outliers that may correspond to attacks.
    </p>

    <h2>Risk Assessment and Probability Modeling</h2>
    <p>
      Risk analysis in cybersecurity often depends on estimating the likelihood and impact of adverse events. 
      Probability distributions allow analysts to quantify uncertainties, 
      while Bayesian models enable continuous updating of risks as new evidence becomes available. 
      For instance, the probability of a successful phishing attack can be modeled 
      and adjusted after each new dataset of observed incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluating Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
      Statistics is also central to evaluating the effectiveness of security controls. 
      Hypothesis testing can verify whether a new firewall policy significantly reduces malicious traffic, 
      while regression models can reveal correlations between system configurations and vulnerability levels. 
      Without statistical validation, cybersecurity defenses risk being based on anecdotal evidence rather than measurable performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Mining and Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Modern cybersecurity tools rely heavily on machine learning, which is rooted in statistical principles. 
      Techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, and neural networks all stem from statistical learning theory. 
      Spam detection, malware classification, fraud prevention, and intrusion detection are just a few examples of areas 
      where statistical models are directly applied to protect systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In summary, statistics is both a theoretical discipline and a practical toolkit that significantly enhances cybersecurity strategies. 
      It enables anomaly detection in massive datasets, supports risk modeling under uncertainty, 
      validates the effectiveness of defenses, and provides the mathematical foundation for machine learning applications. 
      As cyber threats evolve in complexity, the integration of statistical methods becomes increasingly vital 
      for detecting, mitigating, and preventing incidents.<br><br>
      By applying statistics, cybersecurity moves from a reactive discipline to a proactive one, 
      where prevention and intelligent response are guided by data-driven evidence.
