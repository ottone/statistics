  <h2>Introduction</h2>

Probability has been interpreted in different ways throughout its history, each
  offering a distinct perspective on what it means for an event to be “likely.”  
  A first interpretation is the <strong>subjective view</strong>, which associates
  probability with a personal degree of belief, shaped by one’s own knowledge and
  expectations. A second viewpoint is the <strong>frequentist interpretation</strong>,
  which defines probability as the limiting value of the relative frequency of an event
  when the number of trials becomes very large, formally expressed as
  \( F_n \to P \) as \( n \to \infty \).  
  A third traditional approach is the <strong>classical interpretation</strong>,
  which assumes all outcomes are equally likely and evaluates probability by counting
  favourable and possible outcomes.

  While these perspectives provide intuition and historical context, modern probability
  theory is grounded in an <strong>axiomatic framework</strong>. Instead of interpreting
  probability through belief or repeated experimentation, the axiomatic approach relies
  on a small set of fundamental rules from which the entire theory is logically derived.
  This point of view allows probability to be treated with the same level of rigour as
  other branches of pure mathematics.

  The axiomatic formulation of probability is deeply connected to
  <strong>measure theory</strong>. In measure theory, a measure assigns a non-negative
  extended real number to sets in a way that satisfies properties such as
  non-negativity and countable additivity. Probability fits naturally into this
  structure: it is essentially a measure that has been normalized so that the total
  measure of the entire space equals one. This simple condition transforms a generic
  measure space into a probability space.

  Formally, a probability space is described by the triple \( (\Omega, \Sigma, P) \),
  where \( \Omega \) is the sample space containing all possible outcomes,
  \( \Sigma \) is a σ-algebra of measurable events, and \( P \) is a probability
  measure assigning a value between 0 and 1 to each event in \( \Sigma \).
  The σ-algebra ensures that operations such as unions, intersections, and complements
  remain within the set of admissible events, establishing a stable mathematical
  environment in which probability can be defined consistently.

  Understanding probability through this axiomatic and measure-theoretic lens provides
  a unified and coherent foundation for the entire discipline. It also allows powerful
  results—such as subadditivity and the inclusion–exclusion principle—to emerge
  naturally from the underlying structure of the theory, reflecting the deep
  relationship between probability and measures more generally.
 
<h2>1. Measure Theory: The Axiomatic Framework</h2>

  We begin with the concept of a <strong>measure space</strong>.  
  A measure space is a triple:
  $$(X, \Sigma, m)$$

  where:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>X</strong> is the underlying set;</li>
    <li><strong>Σ</strong> is a σ-algebra of subsets of X;</li>
    <li><strong>m</strong> is a measure defined on Σ.</li>
  </ul>

  A σ-algebra satisfies:
  <ul>
    <li>\(\varnothing \in \Sigma\) and \(\,X \in \Sigma\);</li>
    <li>If \(A \in \Sigma\), then the complement \(A^c \in \Sigma\);</li>
    <li>If \(A_1, A_2, \dots \in \Sigma\), then the union \(\bigcup_i A_i \in \Sigma\).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The measure is a function:</p>

  $$
    m : \Sigma \to [0, +\infty]
  $$

<p>satisfying:</p>
  <ol>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-negativity</strong>: \( m(A) \ge 0 \) for all \( A \in \Sigma \);</li>

      <li><strong>Empty set</strong>: \( m(\varnothing) = 0 \);</li>

      <li><strong>Countable additivity (σ-additivity)</strong>:  
          if \( A_i \) are pairwise disjoint:
          <br>
          $$ 
          m\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right)
          = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} m(A_i)
          $$
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>



<h2>2. Probability Theory as a Special Case of Measure Theory</h2>

  Kolmogorov (1933) defines a probability space as:
  $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$$

  where:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ω</strong> is the sample space (all possible outcomes);</li>
    <li><strong>𝔽</strong> is a σ-algebra of events;</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> is a probability measure.</li>
  </ul>

  Kolmogorov's axioms:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Non-negativity and boundedness</strong>:  
        $$0 \le P(A) \le 1 \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{F};$$</li>

    <li><strong>Normalization</strong>:  
        $$ P(\Omega) = 1; $$</li>

    <li><strong>Countable additivity</strong>:  
      if $E_i$ are disjoint events,
      $$ P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right)
         = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i). $$
    </li>
  </ol>

  Thus, probability theory is essentially <strong>measure theory with total measure equal to 1</strong>:
  $$ P(\Omega) = 1. $$

<h2>3. Subadditivity Derived from the Axioms</h2>

  <strong>Subadditivity</strong> states that for any events A and B:
  $$ P(A \cup B) \le P(A) + P(B). $$

  <h4>Proof for two events</h4>

  Decompose:
  $$
    A \cup B = A \,\cup\, (B \setminus A)
  $$
  and note that $A$ and $(B \setminus A)$ are disjoint.

  By additivity:
  $$
    P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B \setminus A).
  $$

  Since $(B \setminus A) \subseteq B$, monotonicity (derived from σ-additivity) gives:
  $$
    P(B \setminus A) \le P(B).
  $$

  Therefore:
  $$
    P(A \cup B) \le P(A) + P(B).
  $$


  <h2>Countable subadditivity</h2>

  <p>For events \(A_1, A_2, \dots\), define:</p>
  
  $$
    B_1 = A_1,\quad
    B_2 = A_2 \setminus A_1,\quad
    B_3 = A_3 \setminus (A_1 \cup A_2),\dots
  $$

  <p>These \(B_i\) are disjoint and satisfy:</p>
  $$
    \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i
    = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i.
  $$

  Then:
  $$
    P\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right)
    = \sum_i P(B_i)
    \le \sum_i P(A_i).
  $$

  This proves general subadditivity.


<h2>4. The Inclusion–Exclusion Principle</h2>


  The inclusion–exclusion principle gives an exact formula for the probability of unions.

  <h2>Two events</h2>

  $$
    P(A \cup B)
    = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).
  $$

  <strong>Sketch of the proof:</strong>
    $$
    A = (A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B)
    $$

    $$
    B = (B \setminus A) \cup (A \cap B)
    $$

    $$
    A \cup B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \cup (A \cap B)
    $$

  Summing the first two and comparing with the last one gives the formula.

  <h2>Three events</h2>

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(A \cup B \cup C) 
  &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - [P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap C) + P(B \cap C)] + P(A \cap B \cap C).
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  <strong>Sketch of the proof.</strong>  
  The idea behind the inclusion–exclusion formula for three sets is to correct the
  overcounting that happens when simply adding the probabilities of the individual
  events.

  <p>
    When we sum \(P(A) + P(B) + P(C)\), each pairwise intersection is counted twice.
    Therefore, we subtract the terms:
    \[
      P(A \cap B), \quad P(A \cap C), \quad P(B \cap C)
    \]
    to compensate for this overcounting.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the region where all three events overlap, \(A \cap B \cap C\),
    has now been subtracted too many times: it was added once in each of the
    three individual terms and subtracted once in each of the three pairwise terms.
    This means it has been removed entirely, so we must add it back exactly once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combining these corrections yields:
  </p>

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  P(A \cup B \cup C)
  &= P(A) + P(B) + P(C) \\
  &\quad - [P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap C) + P(B \cap C)] \\
  &\quad + P(A \cap B \cap C),
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  which is the inclusion–exclusion principle for three events.



  <h2>General finite inclusion–exclusion</h2>

  <p>For \(n\) events, the inclusion–exclusion formula takes the form:</p>

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    P\!\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right)
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i)
       - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} P(A_i \cap A_j) \\
    &\quad + \sum_{1 \le i < j < k \le n} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)
       - \dots \\
    &\quad + (-1)^{\,n-1} P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n).
    \end{aligned}
    $$

  <p>
  This structure is completely general and also holds for any measure \(m\)
  by replacing \(P\) with \(m\).
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>


  In summary, the axiomatic approach places probability within the broader framework of
  measure theory, showing that the two subjects share the same conceptual foundations.  
  A probability measure is nothing more than a particular type of measure whose total
  mass equals one, and this simple observation unifies the theory of probability with
  the general theory of measures.

  By adopting this perspective, probability becomes a rigorously structured discipline
  in which properties are not postulated individually but derived logically from a few
  essential axioms. Concepts such as monotonicity, subadditivity, and continuity of
  measures arise naturally from these axioms, without the need for additional assumptions.
  In particular, subadditivity follows directly from countable additivity and
  non-negativity, reflecting the intuitive idea that the probability of a union can
  never exceed the sum of the probabilities of the individual events.

  The inclusion–exclusion principle further illustrates the depth of the axiomatic
  framework. It provides an exact formula to compute the probability of unions of
  overlapping events by carefully correcting for the regions counted multiple times.
  This principle is not specific to probability: it extends seamlessly to any measure
  space, confirming once again the strong structural connection between probability
  theory and measure theory.

  Overall, viewing probability as a branch of measure theory not only clarifies its
  mathematical nature but also strengthens its conceptual foundations. The axioms serve
  as a solid base from which all the central results of the theory can be systematically
  derived, ensuring both internal coherence and generality.
